        <h3>Magic: The Gathering</h3>
        <h4>A fan-made custom set for MtG.</h4>

        <h4 class="highlighted">Description</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The Plane of Walkers is a custom MtG set designed to play with the rest of the vast MtG card pool. The story is about Planeswalkers that have come together to form a union and make their own plane. Here they can grow and learn and practice their magic without intrusion or destruction of someone else's world. The Plane of Walkers introduces three new mechanics to the game and explores new design space with Planeswalkers. Currently, my friends and I are testing the set out for limited play, such as draft and sealed.</p>
