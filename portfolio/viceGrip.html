        <h3>Infinite Lotus - Software Solutions</h3>
        <h4>Manage your habits and reward systems to achieve your goals!</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Abstract</h4>
        <br>
        <p>When playing games, it's easy for us to increase our characters skills and levels to grow and better our character to face greater challenges. So why can't we do the same for ourselves in the real world? ViceGrip is an application that makes learning, growing, and improving oneself into an RPG-style game! Set goals, skills, or tasks. Assign points to each Habit based on time spent, goal achieved, or more. Setup rewards for yourself and set their value in points. When you work on your habits, you earn points, and can redeem them for your own rewards!</p>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Problem</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The problem is simple. Something each of us face in all phases of our lives. How do we stick to our goals, control our habits, and stay vigilant throughout the process? Often, we set goals for ourselves to learn a skill, kick a habit, or perhaps grow into a new habit. But we all know that sticking to our goals is harder than we think. Changing reoccurring habits is difficult. We often find ourselves losing interest and going back to our old habits without ever reaching our goals.</p>
        <p>Strangely this isn't the case when we play virtual characters in video games. The goals are explicit. The progress is tracked and shown. Our perseverance to reach the next stage maintains strong. So how can we bring the game world into our own lives and treat ourselves the way we treat our digital aliases? How can we gamify our habits to be more efficient and, more importantly, vigilant in our efforts?</p>
        <p>Lastly, there is a business problem. While this application can help people reach their goals and set rewards for themselves, it is completely free. Furthermore, there is no clear monetization factor with habits on a personal level. So, how can we introduce monetization for Infinite Lotus through this application?</p>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Process</h4>
        <br>
        <p>As with any UX problem. I started by interviewing the stakeholders to intimately understand what the application was, who it was for, how they would use it, what it hoped to achieve, what the companies goals for the application were, and finally; what they expected out of the design process for the development team, the marketing team, and the internal teams.</p>
        <p>After interviewing with the Project Lead, the Lead Developer, and a few other stakeholders; I had a solid foundation for the idea of the application. The next step was to process the information and roughly sketch out an initial design layout to help strengthen the communication between the design team and the rest of the company.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Application Map" src="vicegrip/App_Map.jpg" alt="Application Map"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Application Map - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>I started out with the application map. It's quite simple. The user starts on the home screen <i>(shown below)</i>. As with a lot of popular apps, they can swipe in a direction to move to a different screen. Swiping down lead you to the top screen, your Habits. Beneath you find your Rewards. <i>Note here I initially jotted them as "Awards" in my sketches</i>. To the left you find your special habits, the Promos. These are how we solved the monetization aspect of the application. Finally, to the right, is the options menu.</p>
        <br>

        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Home Screen - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>The next thing I sketched was the Home Screen. Since this application will be used multiple times a day, it is essential that we get the home screen correct. As it is the first thing the user sees on start-up and there should be zero friction when you're maintaining your habits. The initial design was a bit off, but even here the importance of the top three habits was important. Later, the screen would emphasize this and reduce the logo and options button further.</p>

        <br>
        <p>I then focused on the core of the application, the Habits.</p>
