        <h3>Infinite Lotus - Software Solutions</h3>
        <h4>Manage your habits and reward systems to achieve your goals!</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Abstract</h4>
        <br>
        <p>When playing games, it's easy for us to increase our characters' skills and levels to grow and better our character to face greater challenges. So why can't we do the same for ourselves in the real world? ViceGrip is an application that makes learning, growing, and improving oneself into an RPG-style game! Set goals, skills, or tasks. Assign points to each Habit based on time spent, goal achieved, or more. Setup rewards for yourself and set their value in points. When you work on your habits, you earn points, and can redeem them for your own rewards!</p>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Problem</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The problem is simple. Something each of us face in all phases of our lives. How do we stick to our goals, control our habits, and stay vigilant throughout the process? Often, we set goals for ourselves to learn a skill, kick a habit, or perhaps grow into a new habit. But we all know that sticking to our goals is harder than we think. Changing reoccurring habits is difficult. We often find ourselves losing interest and going back to our old habits without ever reaching our goals.</p>
        <p>Strangely this isn't the case when we play virtual characters in video games. The goals are explicit. The progress is tracked and shown. Our perseverance to reach the next stage maintains strong. So how can we bring the game world into our own lives and treat ourselves the way we treat our digital aliases? How can we gamify our habits to be more efficient and, more importantly, vigilant in our efforts?</p>
        <p>Lastly, there is a business problem. While this application can help people reach their goals and set rewards for themselves, it is completely free. Furthermore, there is no clear monetization factor with habits on a personal level. So, how can we introduce monetization for Infinite Lotus through this application?</p>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Process</h4>
        <br>
        <p>As with any UX problem. I started by interviewing the stakeholders to intimately understand what the application was, who it was for, how they would use it, what it hoped to achieve, what the companies goals for the application were, and finally; what they expected out of the design process for the development team, the marketing team, and the internal teams.</p>
        <p>After interviewing with the Project Lead, the Lead Developer, and a few other stakeholders; I had a solid foundation for the idea of the application. The next step was to process the information and roughly sketch out an initial design layout to help strengthen the communication between the design team and the rest of the company.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Application Map" src="vicegrip/App_Map.jpg" alt="Application Map"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Application Map - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>I started out with the application map. It's quite simple. The user starts on the home screen <i>(shown below)</i>. As with a lot of popular apps, they can swipe in a direction to move to a different screen. Swiping down lead you to the top screen, your Habits. Beneath you find your Rewards. <i>Note here I initially jotted them as "Awards" in my sketches</i>. To the left you find your special habits, the Promos. These are how we solved the monetization aspect of the application. Finally, to the right, is the options menu.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Home Screen" src="vicegrip/Home_Screen.jpg" alt="Home Screen"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Home Screen - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>The next thing I sketched was the Home Screen. Since this application will be used multiple times a day, it is essential that we get the home screen correct. As it is the first thing the user sees on start-up and there should be zero friction when you're maintaining your habits. The initial design was a bit off, but even here the importance of the top three habits was important. Later, the screen would emphasize this and reduce the logo and options button further.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Home Screen Detailed" src="vicegrip/Home_Screen_Detail.jpg" alt="Home Screen Detailed"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Home Screen - More Detailed Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>I then focused on the core of the application, the Habits.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Habits Screen" src="vicegrip/Habits_New.jpg" alt="Habits Screen"/>

        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Organize Habits - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Edit Habits" src="vicegrip/Habits_Edit.jpg" alt="Edit Habits"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Edit Habits - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Complete Habits" src="vicegrip/Habits_Complete.jpg" alt="Complete Habits"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Complete Habits - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>The highlight of the application, the actual Habits. When you swipe to the Habits screen you first see your current Habits in priority order. The first four will be the ones highlighted on the home screen for easy access. It is meant for the habits you are focusing on and/or the habits that need the most upkeep i.e. daily Habits.</p>
        <p>Habits should be easy to create and maintain as they are the core of the application. They each have a title, a description, an increment type, and the points earned. For example, let's say you want to go to the gym more often. The title is require but can be whatever you want, such as "Go to the Gym". You may optionally add a description for notes or details. In this example it might be "20 minutes of cardio. 40 minutes of weights". Then you can set the increment type. These can be one time events such as errands, custom increments for daily tasks such as drinking more water, or timed events; like we'll use for this gym example. Finally, you set your points based on the increment. Since we have chosen a timed event, the points awarded will be per hour. In this case we'll set it to 50 points per hour. This point system is completely up to you. The difference between 5, 50, 500, or 5 billion points depends on you and your rewards. When your done, the new Habit will appear in the fifth position of your list be default. This assumes that it is the highest priority Habit <i>after</i> your main four Habits. You can simply reorder your Habits by holding and dragging to the appropriate position. This will automatically push the other Habits respectively. When you click and hold, it will also display a quick delete in the corner of the Habit. There will be a second message pop-up to circumvent an accidental deletion. In the Habit edit menu, you can easily copy a Habit for convenient creation of other similar Habits. Once a habit is completed, it will automatically delete if it was a one time task; or reset if it was a recurring Habit, such as the one in our example.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Rewards" src="vicegrip/Rewards_New.jpg" alt="Rewards"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Rewards - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Rewards Example" src="vicegrip/Rewards_Detail.jpg" alt="Rewards Example"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Rewards Example - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Rewards Edit" src="vicegrip/Rewards_Edit.jpg" alt="Rewards Edit"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Rewards Edit - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>The motivation comes in the form of Rewards. Just like Habits, you set your own Rewards and their value.</p>
        <p>Rewards are much simpler. They have a title, an optional description, recurrence, and a value. Like Habits, they can be copied and deleted. Let's say one of your rewards is going out to a nice restaurant. You would set a title such as "Dinner at <i>La Restaurant</i>", an optional description such as "A nice night out at your favourite restaurant". Then you would set a value. Remember, these should reflect your points earned from your Habits. Let's say for this example we set this Reward at "300 points". Finally, since you can redeem this reward multiple times, you would set the recurrence to "Multiple" rather than "Single".</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Promos" src="vicegrip/Promos_New.jpg" alt="Promos"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Promos - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Promos Example" src="vicegrip/Promos_Detail.jpg" alt="Promos Example"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Promos Example - Rough Sketch</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, we have Promos! This was our solution to the monetization problem. How can you monetize an app about routine habits? Through the reward system, of course!</p>
        <p>Promos work just like Rewards and their Habits, except for one important detail: they aren't set by you. Promos are Rewards and Habits set by your favourite companies such as retail, food, and digital goods; or services like spas. On the business end, Promos are a different way of managing loyalty programs for your customers. In the example above, we can see a simple coffee shop loyalty Promo award. Whenever you drink a hot beverage from them you'll get a QR code that you can scan with your app to increment your Habit. Then you can redeem the rewards in real life! In this example buying a hot beverage gets you "1 Coffee Bean"! You can then redeem 5 "Coffee Beans" to get a free beverage!</p>
        <p>This solution is an elegant way to monetize the application. It doesn't change the nature of the application and it rewards customers for doing what they might already do. Thereby promoting customer loyalty. The platform serves as a way to keep all your loyalty programs, promotions, contests, and more; in one place. In a platform the users already visit daily. Infinite Lotus can then make deals with various companies to manage their promotional programs. The value being an already built and established platform as well as a customer base.</p>
        <div class="lineBreak"></div>
        <p>After the initial sketch phase, I discussed the quick sketches with the project lead to ensure I had understood the concept well and we were ready to create the mock-ups.</p>
        <br>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Solution</h4>
        <br>
        <p>After a few iterations and reviewing with the team I finalized the low fidelity mock-ups. I was only contracted to deign up to the low fidelity mock-ups final iteration. The next step was to simultaneously pass the design documents over to the graphic design team and the development team. I quite like this work-flow process.</p>
        <p>You can see all of the screens below expect the option page. The options menu will contain very minor settings throughout the application such as language and font size. Since this will be added in the last step in development and is a very simple menu that the graphic art team will stylize, I was not required to design that page.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Home Screen" src="vicegrip/Home.png" alt="Home Screen"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Home Screen - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>This is the home screen of the application. It is the most important page since it's the first one the user sees on startup. It should provide quick access to the their prioritized Habits so they can easily update and maintain them. This is vital to the UX of the application. ViceGrip is all about constant use. If you don't track your Habits you won't maintain them. So the less friction involved in doing so, the better. We have too many applications and other distractions that we pay our attention to daily, so it is critical to get the home screen right for an application like this.</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Home Screen - New User" src="vicegrip/Home_New_User.png" alt="Home Screen - New User"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Home Screen - New User - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>This is the alternate home screen UI. This is what a user will see when the first install the app. It is meant to be simple and minimalist. Your attention is drawn to the very first and most important action we want the user to take: making their first Habit. After that the home screen will look like the screen above.</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Habits" src="vicegrip/Habits_List_Organize.png" alt="Habits"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Habits - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>Now we get to the core of the application. The Habits page. Here you can organize, edit, maintain, delete, copy, and review your Habits. Notice that the top four Habits are highlighted. That's because these four are the ones to appear on the front page for easiest access. You can push one-time Habits to the bottom since they don't need constant updating. I proposed an idea to help encourage users to make more Habits. When you create a new Habit the fields will have placeholders of real common Habits people may want, such as the ones you see in the mock-ups. It's low priority for the development team, but it's not that big of a task; developmentally speaking. The team can choose to add it after release in a later version if they so choose. When you click and hold any of the Habits, you will get the screen on the right. Here you can quickly delete or rearrange your Habits. Very intuitive and common mobile application UI.</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Incrementing Habits" src="vicegrip/Habits_Increment.png" alt="Incrementing Habits"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Incrementing Habits - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>To maintain a Habit from the Habits menu or the home page, simply click the icon on the right side. This will open a sub-menu to easily maintain each habit quickly. Whether it's incrementing it by a single unit or bulk updating for the entire day. In this example you can see someone has practiced the guitar for an hour and a half. They simply input that value and it adds to the total time and how many points they've earned. The same can be done for all Habits and straight from the home screen as well.</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Increment Types" src="vicegrip/Habits_Increment_Types.png" alt="Increment Types"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Increment Types - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>There are three kinds of Habits. Time based, single-event, and incremental. For time based Habits you set whether you want minutes, hourly, or daily. The increment is simply an amount of time. The application will then award you the appropriate points you've set for yourself. For single-event Habits, you simply check that they're done, similar to a to-do list item. This is the only Habit that deletes itself upon completion. You can make multiple similar single-event Habits by using the Copy feature in the edit menu of any Habit. Finally, there are incremental Habits. These are simply incremented by a number of actions you've taken to fulfill the Habit. In our example, the user wants to drink more water throughout their day. So they've set a goal, set a point value per glass and can increment in single glasses or all at once at the end of each day.</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Editing Habits" src="vicegrip/Habits_Edit.png" alt="Editing Habits"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Editing Habits - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>Here we see the how to edit a Habit. Note that this the same screen for creating a Habit. It's quite simple and intuitive. All fields are required except a description. That's just there if you want to keep notes or details about the Habit for yourself. The categories for "Type" are "Single-Event", "Incremental", "Timed - Minutes", "Timed - Hourly", and "Timed - Days".</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Deleting Habits" src="vicegrip/Habits_Delete.png" alt="Deleting Habits"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Deleting Habits - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>As is standard experience for deleting something important, there is an additional confirmation pop-up to avoid accidental deletion of Habits. Users can also copy a Habit and edit the copy before deleting the original.</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Rewards" src="vicegrip/Rewards.png" alt="Rewards"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Rewards - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>The Rewards screen is very similar to the Habits screen except even simpler. You set your own Rewards and costs so it's up to you to determine what each Habit is worth and in turn, what each personal Reward should be! Once you redeem a Reward, it will subtract the cost from your point total but will remain a Reward. Most Rewards can be fun to redeem multiple times, so there's no point in auto deleting a Reward after redeeming it. That would just lead to a frustrating UX where the user would have to create the same Rewards if they want them on their Rewards list again. We encourage making Rewards before working on Habits as it is a nice goal to work towards, but more importantly; it's tempting to set Rewards to a lower value than they're worth if we've been working towards a Habit and want to cheat a little. So it's better to determine a Rewards value before the urge to redeem them.</p>
        <img class="sketch" title="ViceGrip - Promos" src="vicegrip/Promos.png" alt="Promos"/>
        <figcaption class="caption">ViceGrip - Promos - Low Fidelity Mock-up</figcaption>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, we have the Promos page. This is where the monetization of the application comes from. It is quite unique in that it is both the Habit and Reward but the user cannot edit them, for obvious reasons. In these examples we see two depictions of possible customer loyalty Rewards. For Tim Hortons, they can award their loyal customer a free beverage for every three they buy. Lululemon needs more new customer walking through their doors so they've opted for a Promo where if you refer a friend you both get 10% off your next purchase. These are just two examples but the Promos can be used in many ways such as: contests, one-time promotions, new product advertising, stamp-card replacements, holiday events, sales, and more! The advantage the company gets is having their promotions viewed by all the users of ViceGrip! For the user, their customer loyalty and retail rewards are all in one convenient place. It also feels like a free bonus for using the app!</p>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Deduction</h4>
        <br>
        <p>ViceGrip is a fairly simple application that has a very valuable offer to the user. The focus should be on ease of use and avoidance of clutter and extra features. It took some time and convincing, but a lot of ancillary features proposed by the marketing and sales teams were stripped out. This was to focus the user flow to what was important about the application to ensure regular use and maintenance of the application. The great part of the Promo page is that Infinite Lotus can promote ViceGrip to more users by incentivizing their users to spread the word about the application to their friends.</p>
        <p>Since I've designed the UI/UX, both the graphic design and development teams can concurrently work on the final aspects of visual design and the code for iOS and Android platforms. Since the overall structure is defined, neither team will be waiting on one another for deliverables; and both teams will be on the same page in terms of goals and UX and user-flow. I remained with the team for some time to review the design decisions, help with the development, answer any questions, help with marketing, and for general advisory. I really enjoyed this structure since after the low fidelity mock-up was complete the development process was quickened and both teams could work at once saving an immense amount of time and work.</p>
        <p>You'll have to wait to get ViceGrip for yourself as Infinite Lotus is still in their pre-Alpha phase of developing this app. But in the mean time, I think their sales and marketing teams will be just as busy as their graphic designers and their developers! I look forward to working on more projects with Infinite Lotus, as they are great to work with and their ideas are awesome!</p>
