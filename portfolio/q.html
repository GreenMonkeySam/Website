        <h4>Digital Queuing. Never wait in-person again.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="highlighted">Abstract</h4>
        <br>
        <p>We wait in lines for everything: doctors, mechanics, gym equipment, phone calls, food...the list goes on. In the digital age, why are we still waiting in-person? Q is the app that holds your place in line for whatever (Q)ueue you're waiting on. Get notifications at any interval: seconds, minutes, hours, or even days. Automatically join queues when you enter a geo-location or building. Enter queues for festivals while you take care of other business. Never get caught waiting hours for your appointments. Take your precious time back and let Q do the waiting for you.</p>
        <p>Q is an app that should make your life easier. So my challenge was to make an easy-to-use app that let's you avoid waiting in a queue as easily and fluidly as possible. You should be able to use Q with minimal setup and each line should be easy to get into and easy to track for both sides of the process. Marketing is also a huge portion of this user-experience as the businesses that have queues need to spread the application with minimal friction.</p>
