        <h3>Infinite Lotus - Software Solutions</h3>
        <h4>Clear the clutter and browse the web in a different way.</h4>

        <p>How many tabs do you have open right now? Which one contains the page you're looking for? If you're the type of person to browse with multiple tabs open all at once while working, playing, or simply browsing; Bubble Browse will change the way you explore the web. Remove the clutter, organize your tabs, and Bubble Browse!</p>
        <p>Bubble Browse is the ultimate UX challenge. Reorganize the way people use web-browsers to create the best possible experience. To tackle such a daunting challenge we studied people's browsing behaviours and brainstormed many different solutions. We settled on a bubble method of organizing different web pages that are then organized in a circular menu. This is all done with a minor AI working in the background. Before we launch, we'll have to test the latest solution with as many groups as possible to make Bubble Browse the best way to experience the web.</p>
